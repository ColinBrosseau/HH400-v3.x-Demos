The llbs in this folder are those we developed and tested with LabVIEW8 32bit.
As we do not have a 64bit version we have not been able to test under x64 Linux.
If you have a 64bit LabVIEW please try loading these files and adjust the 
references to hhlib.so to  /usr/local/lib64/hh400/hhlib.so.
After that it is most likely to work fine.
